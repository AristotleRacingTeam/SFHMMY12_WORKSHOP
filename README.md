# SFHMMY12_WORKSHOP
Source Code as seen from our workshop presentation in SFHMMY12 

These are the catkin packages created in our workshop in order to create and control a differential-drive robot in gazebo.

In 'mybot_description' folder there are the .xacro files that describe our differential-drive robot plus the plugin files

In 'mybot_gazebo' folder there are the .launch and .py files required to simulate the autonomus system in gazebo.
